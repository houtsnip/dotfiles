# convert-meta
# If set to ‘on’, Readline will convert characters with the eighth bit set to
# an ASCII key sequence by stripping the eighth bit and prefixing an ESC
# character, converting them to a meta-prefixed key sequence. The default value
# is ‘on’, but will be set to ‘off’ if the locale is one that contains
# eight-bit characters.
#set convert-meta off

# enable-meta-key
# When set to ‘on’, Readline will try to enable any meta modifier key the
# terminal claims to support when it is called. On many terminals, the meta key
# is used to send eight-bit characters. The default is ‘on’.
#set enable-meta-key off

# input-meta
# If set to ‘on’, Readline will enable eight-bit input (it will not clear the
# eighth bit in the characters it reads), regardless of what the terminal
# claims it can support. The default value is ‘off’, but Readline will set it
# to ‘on’ if the locale contains eight-bit characters. The name meta-flag is a
# synonym for this variable.
#set input-meta on

# output-meta
# If set to ‘on’, Readline will display characters with the eighth bit set
# directly rather than as a meta-prefixed escape sequence. The default is
# ‘off’, but Readline will set it to ‘on’ if the locale contains eight-bit
# characters.
#set output-meta on
